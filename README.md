Import Json file into MongoDB

```mongoimport -d school -c students < HW3.1students.json
```


HW 3.2 

```
# XXX HW 3.2 Work Here to insert the post
self.posts.insert(post, j=True)
```

```
# XXX HW 3.2 Work here to get the posts
cursor = self.posts.find().sort([('date',-1)]).limit(num_posts)
```

```
# XXX Work here to retrieve the specified post
post = self.posts.find_one({'permalink':permalink})
```


Shell output:

  CRUD (Creating, Reading and Updating Data) - Mongo shell, query operators, update operators and a few commands. Create the `user` and `session` class for the blog app


	Use curl to download a json file and read it in python 

	``` 
	curl https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/.json > reddit.json
	cat reddit.json | python -m json.tool | more
	python read_reddit.py
	mongo
	# in mongo shell
	use reddit
	show collections
	db.stories.findOne()
	db.stroies.find().pretty()
	```

	2.1 JS file that creates a database in Mongo
	`mongo < 2.1school.js`

	2.4 Regex
	Mongo regex has an option of case insensitivity `'$options':'i'`

	2.5 Skip, limit, sort 
	order: sort first, then skip, then limit

	2.6 insert_one()

	2.7 insert_many()
	In `people.insert_many(people_to_insert,ordered=False)`, the `ordered=False` does not preserve the data when it's inserted into the database as in `people_to_insert = [andrew,richard]`

	`ordered = True` by default

	2.8 update_one() and update_many()

	2.9 replace_one()
	Cannot use `$set` in `replace_one()`

	2.11 delete_one() and delete_many()

	2.12 find_and_modify(), find_one_and_update()

	HW 2.1

	import json file into MongoDB

	```mongoimport -d students -c grades < grades.json```
